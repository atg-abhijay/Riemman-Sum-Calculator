# Riemman-Sum-Calculator
In mathematics, a Riemman sum is an approximation that takes the form  
summation f(x)*(delta x). It is named after German mathematician Bernhard Riemann. One very common application is approximating the area of functions or lines on a graph, but also the length of curves and other approximations. (Wikipedia)
